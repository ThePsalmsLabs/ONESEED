# Production Readiness Progress

## ‚úÖ Completed (Session 1)

### New Hooks Created
1. **usePortfolio.ts** - Aggregates all portfolio data from savings, DCA, and daily savings
2. **useActivityFeed.ts** - Real-time activity feed from blockchain events
3. **useDCAAnalytics.ts** - DCA execution analytics and statistics
4. **useSlippageAnalytics.ts** - Slippage monitoring and alert system
5. **useTokenMetadata.ts** - Token metadata fetching with caching

### Components Updated (Mock Data Removed)
1. **PortfolioOverview.tsx** - Now uses real portfolio data from usePortfolio hook
2. **ActivityFeed.tsx** - Now reads real events from blockchain via useActivityFeed

### Infrastructure
- Installed `date-fns` for date formatting
- All hooks use proper TypeScript typing
- Event-based data fetching from contract logs
- Token metadata caching (24hr stale time)

## üöß In Progress

### Dashboard Components (3 remaining)
- [ ] PerformanceMetrics.tsx - Replace mock performance data
- [ ] AnalyticsDashboard.tsx - Replace mock analytics
- [ ] TokenBalanceCard.tsx - Already using real data ‚úì

### DCA Components (3 remaining)
- [ ] DCAExecutionMonitor.tsx - Connect to real DCA queue
- [ ] DCAHistory.tsx - Use DCA events for history
- [ ] DCAQueueManager.tsx - Real-time queue management

### Slippage Components (3 remaining)
- [ ] SlippageMonitor.tsx - Real-time slippage monitoring
- [ ] SlippageAlerts.tsx - Use real alert system
- [ ] SlippageStatistics.tsx - Real slippage stats

### Withdrawal Components (4 remaining)
- [ ] WithdrawalWizard.tsx - Connect to real balances
- [ ] BatchWithdrawalManager.tsx - Real batch withdrawal
- [ ] WithdrawalStrategies.tsx - Calculate real strategies
- [ ] PenaltyPreview.tsx - Real penalty calculations

### Settings Components (2 remaining)
- [ ] StrategyTemplates.tsx - Store templates properly
- [ ] ComparisonTools.tsx - Real strategy comparison

## üìã Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete Core Dashboard
1. Update PerformanceMetrics with real savings/DCA data
2. Update AnalyticsDashboard with comprehensive analytics
3. Test dashboard page fully

### Priority 2: DCA Features
1. Update DCA components to use useDCAAnalytics
2. Real-time queue monitoring
3. Historical execution tracking

### Priority 3: Safety Features
1. Update all slippage protection components
2. Real-time monitoring and alerts
3. Statistical analysis

### Priority 4: Withdrawal Flow
1. Update withdrawal wizard with real token balances
2. Accurate penalty calculations
3. Batch withdrawal support

### Priority 5: Polish & Testing
1. Remove all remaining mock data
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Test all flows end-to-end
4. Performance optimization

## üéØ Success Criteria

When complete, the frontend will:
- ‚úÖ Have ZERO mock data anywhere
- ‚úÖ All components connected to real contract reads
- ‚úÖ Event-based activity feeds and history
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates on new blocks
- ‚úÖ Token metadata properly displayed
- ‚úÖ Proper loading and error states everywhere
- ‚úÖ Ready for production deployment (just add contract addresses)

## üîß Technical Improvements Made

1. **Event Listening**: All activity tracked via contract events
2. **Caching Strategy**: Token metadata cached for 24hrs, balances refresh every 30s
3. **Type Safety**: All hooks properly typed with contract types
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when contract events unavailable
5. **Performance**: Parallel data fetching, optimized re-renders
6. **Real-time Updates**: Block number watching for live data

## üìù Notes

- Contract addresses still need to be updated in `src/contracts/addresses.ts` after deployment
- Some historical data will be empty initially (performance charts need event history)
- Token prices not yet integrated (would need price oracle or API)
- All components gracefully handle empty states
